## Project 1 - Programming Refresher - Personal Expense Tracker

For this project, I have created an application to track and manage personal expenses. The application allows users to log daily expenses, categorize them, and track spending against their monthly budget. The application allows users to save expenses to persistent storage so that they may be loaded in the future. The user controls the program through an interactive, menu-driven interface. I have implemented some exception handling to ensure proper data is input. Future development of this program could include expansion of functionality and more exception handling. A new feature could be viewing expenses by category. The program should also verify that users enter dates in the correct format (YYYY-MM-DD). For now, this application functions as a simple personal expense tracker that demonstrates my Python programming abilities.
